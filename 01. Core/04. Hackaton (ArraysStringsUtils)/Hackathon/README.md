# Hackathon

## Description

Your task is to implement methods that work with Strings and Arrays.

## Getting Started

Download the Skeleton project and push it to your Buddy Group GitLab Repository. Then add your method implementations to ***`ArrayHelpers.java`*** and ***`StringHelpers.java`***.

## Requirements

- You can create new (`private`) methods, but ***do not*** modify the existing ones.
- Each member _**must**_ implement at least four methods.
- Each member _**must**_ be able to explain how their code works. 
- Each member _**must**_ be able to explain how the entire project works and why it was implemented that way.
- Each method _**must**_ have documentation that is similar to how Oracle documents Java methods. For example: [Integer.compare()](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#compare(int,%20int))
  - There should be 4 sections - **Description**, **Parameters**, **Returns** and **Author**.
    - *Description* - A short summary of what the method is supposed to do.
    - *Parameters* - The name and type of the method's arguments. 
    - *Returns* - The type of the returned value, if applicable; otherwise use `void`.
    - *Author* - Who implemented the method.

### Documentation Example

```java
    /**
    * Concatenates <code>string1</code> to the end of <code>string2</code>.
    *
    * @param string1 The left part of the new string
    * @param string2 The right part of the new string
    * @return A string that represents the concatenation of string1 followed by string2's characters.
    *
    * @author Nadya Atanasova
    */
    public static String concat(String string1, String string2) {
        return string1 + string2;
    }
```

## Constraints
- Do not use any of the build-in methods from `System.java`, `String.java`, `Arrays.java` or `StringBuilder.java`.

## Hints
- Reusing code is great. If you see an opportunity, do it!

Good luck!
